                <h2>League Overview</h2>
                <p>This is a dynasty fantasy football league. Rosters carry over from year to year, and the action never stops. This is a league that features large starting requirements, big benches, IDPs, annual rookie drafts, and tradeable draft picks.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this document is to clearly outline the structure, settings, and rules of the league.If a rule is not explicitly stated, interpretations will consider these criteria and new rules will be voted on and subsequently documented in these bylaws. If this document disagrees with league site settings, site settings will prevail until corrected.</p>
                <h3 class="BasicSettings">Basic league settings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>12 teams, no divisions</li>
                    <li>6 team, 3 week playoffs</li>
                    <li>$100 yearly league dues, payouts to 1st 2nd and 3rd place with 4 individual bonus payouts</li>
                    <li>44 man roster, 6 IR, 6 Taxi Squad</li>
                    <li>Starting requirements - 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE, 3 RB/WR/TE, 1 PK, 2 DL, 2 LB, 2 DB, 1 DL/LB/DB</li>

            <div id="Draft">
                <h2>Annual rookie and free agent draft</h2>
                <p>An annual 6 round rookie and free agent draft will be held each year within a week after the actual NFL draft. 2020’s draft will be a live online draft hosted on MFL’s website.</p>
                <p>Draft order for non-playoff teams will be sorted by MFL's Potential Points statistic (goes into effect for 2021 draft). The team with the lowest PP gets the 1st pick, on through the 6th. Playoff team's pick order will be inverse of final standings, AKA champ and runner up get 12th and 11th pick and so forth.</p>
                <p>There will be a 3 minute clock for each pick. If a pick is not made before the clock expires, the system will automatically pick a player for the owner based on the highest-ranked available player on the owner's "My Draft List" player ranking, and then once that list is exhausted, according to rankings displayed on the ADP page.</p>
                <p><span>It is HIGHLY RECCOMENDED to make your own rankings as the MFL default is pretty shit</span></p>
            </div>
            <div id="Taxi">
                <h2>Taxi Squad</h2>
                <p>Each manager will have six available Taxi Squad (TS) slots. Players on the taxi squad will not count towards the active roster total.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only 1st and 2nd year players are eligible for the TS.</li>
                    <li>Once a player is moved from a manager’s TS to their active roster, they are no longer eligible to be moved back to that manager’s TS. They must either remain on the active roster or be cut to waivers.</li> 
                    <li>TS is in effect at all times.</li>
                    <li>A google doc spreadsheet that tracks TS movement can be found in the league links section of the links tab on MFL, on the Hogball Facebook page, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIhxmZyARDdpgWPoVpSzxfRdZZVcGoefODpq_bm6eBM/edit#gid=419332794">here</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Course of action for a Taxi Squad violation will be:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The player will be cut by the commissioner. It is strongly recommended to check the TS tracking google doc before making any moves, and to contact a commissioner directly if still unsure.</li>
                    <li>Multiple violations by an owner in a season could leave that owner open to further discipline.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="ir">
                <h2>Injured reserve</h2>
                <p>There are 6 IR roster spots that can be used for players with the “OUT” or “IR” designation. Players on the injured reserve will not count towards the active roster total. A violation occurs when a player who is no longer under the OUT/IR designation remain on an owners IR. When in violation, owners are not permitted to submit lineups.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="FAAB">
                <h2>FAAB</h2>
                <p>The Free Agent Acquisition Budget system (also known as a FAAB) allocates a budget of fake "money" to each team before the season for them to spend on free agent players on waivers. Waiver claims are awarded to the highest bidder instead of the worst-ranked team. If there is a tie, the player with the earliest bid will win. Each time a claim is processed, the bid amount is deducted from the remaining budget.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Teams would be allocated an FAAB in a league wide equal amount of $1000. This amount is reset for all teams at the start of each new league year.</li>
                    <li>Bids can only be made in increments of $1</li>
                    <li>FAAB budget is a tradable asset.</li>

                <h2>Teams and ownership</h2>
                <p>The league will consist of 12 teams with no divisions. each time will play every team once, and two teams twice.</p>
                <p>After the annual rookie/fa draft, the schedule for the following season will be based upon the final standings of the prior season. (teams who finished near each other play each other)</p>
                <p>If an owner should choose not to return, the commisioner will find a replacement owner using whatever means necessary to keep the league stable.</p>

                <h2>Dues</h2>
                <p>League dues are $100 per season per team and are non-refundable.</p>
                <p>If an owner leaves the league for any reason, his dues are forfeited to the prize pool and he will have no claim to them in any way. This includes if he finds a replacement owner, unless the replacement owner is willing to reimburse him and pay the dues required to join the league.</p>
                <p>If an owner cannot reasonably meet the dues deadline, they must notify the Commissioner and make alternate arrangements. Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of their team for the current season and seeking a replacement owner. Don’t be that guy.</p>

                <p>League rosters will consist of no more than 44 players during the regular season. Taxi Squad and IR players do not count towards the active roster. After the season concludes, rosters will expand to 90 until a week after the draft.</p> 
                <p>One week after the rookie/free agent draft, rosters will go from the offseason 90, to the regular season roster limit + the number of picks held by the owner with the most picks from the previous draft. (example - Klay had 9 picks in the rookie draft, leading the league. Which would bring the roster limit to 44+9 = 53)</p>
                <p>All teams are required to reduce their rosters to the mandated regular season limit (44) by the end of the NFL preseason.</p>
                <p>Teams are required to submit a full starting lineup to the best of their ability each regular season week during the regular season and, if applicable, each playoff week.</p>
                <p>A starting lineup shall consist of 18 players:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 quarterback (qb)</li>

                        <li>1 defensive flex (dl / dt / lb / s)</li>

                </p>
                <p>Player positions are determined by the MFL site. No restirctions are currently in place.</p>
                <p>Owners should be aware that MFL may change a player’s position at any time pursuant to that player’s NFL team changing their position, e.g switching a player who was previously a wide receiver (WR) that of a running back (RB). These changes shall not be overruled by the League under any circumstances. These changes become effective when they are made by MFL.</p>
                <p>Owners are responsible for assessing the possibility that a given player may change positions before acquiring the player.</p>
                <p>Players are not locked into a team's starting lineup until the game in which the player is participating in has kicked off, at which point they may not be removed.</p>
                <p>Owners who know they will be unavailable to set their team’s lineup  shall use their best efforts to inform the Commissioner and designate the Commissioner to set or change their team’s lineup. Should a lineup not be set by a team, barring extreme circumstances, too bad, deal with it. In this case, the Commissioner reserves the right to submit an alternate competitive lineup if deemed necessary in order to maintain league integrity (ie: no team starting 5 injured players will be allowed).</p>

                <h2>Waivers and free agency</h2>
                <p>Any player not on a league roster is considered a free agent. Free agents may be claimed by owners during one of two periods each week: The Waivers Period and the First Come, First Served (FCFS) Period. Free agents whose NFL teams have participated in a game and players dropped since the last Waiver Period ended are not eligible to be claimed until the following Waiver Period.</p>
                <p>The Waiver Period consists of owners placing Waiver Requests. This period begins after the end of the final NFL game of a week and the bidding is adjudicated Wednesdays at 6 PM ET (approximately). A player to be dropped (if desired or necessary to meet roster requirements) can be identified when the waiver request on a free agent is placed.</p>

                <h2>Trades</h2>
                <p>Trading is the lifeblood of a dynasty league. Limits on trading shall be rare, and when in doubt, a trade will be allowed.</p>
                <p>Owners are not allowed to trade during the playoffs.</p>
                <p>Once a trade has been proposed and accepted via the site, it cannot be rescinded except for owner error. If a trade was offered or accepted in error, the owner making the error must notify the Commissioner and the owner of the other team immediately (i.e. within 5 minutes of the trade's acceptance) to request that the trade be voided. Trades will only be revoked because of legitimate owner error that is reported in a timely manner; owners may not request that a trade be voided due to buyer’s remorse, seller’s remorse or failure to perform due diligence before proposing or accepting a trade.</p>
                <p>Owners should use their best efforts to respond promptly to trade offers from other owners. Owners are encouraged to check for trade offers every time they log on to the site, and owners should immediately reject a trade they deem unacceptable. During the offseason, owners seeking a trade should take it upon themselves to directly contact other owners for trade via email/facebook etc as logging into the site will be less common during this period.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners, under  the most rare circumstances, can decide that a trade is either anti-competitive, or not in the best long-term interest of the league. In this very extreme case, the Commissioners reserve the right to disallow the trade. The rationale for this trade veto will be documented on the group FB page. A Commissioner trade veto can be overridden by 8 of 12 owners.</p>

                <h2>Official statistics and scoring change</h2>
                <p>Every week after all NFL games are played and all fantasy scores are calculated, the Elias Sports Bureau reviews all NFL games for the purposes of locating and calculating any necessary corrections to the official team and player statistics compiled during each game. These corrections will be applied to league scores when they are released by Elias and the NFL, which is usually on Wednesday morning.</p>
                <p>Owners should be aware that the outcome of a game that was tied or won by a small margin may change after the Elias Sports Bureau’s scoring corrections are applied. MFL will apply the official scoring corrections without exception, and owners may not appeal the changed scoring, the changed outcome of a game, or request that the official scoring corrections be disregarded.</p>

                <h2>Orphan teams</h2>
                <p>Orphan teams can be created through the following circumstances</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quitting owner</li>
                    <li>Abondoning owner: if an owner fails to set a lineup</li>
                    <li>Removal of an owner for failure to pay league fees</li>
                    <li>Removal of an owner for collusion</li>
                    <li>Removal of an owner for repeated failure to participate in league events. (votes, draft etc)</li>
                    <li>Removal of an owner for repeated failure to adhere to league rules or abide by commisioner rulings.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a team is orphaned during the season, the commisioner will only set that team's lineup based on highest projections until a new owner is found.</p>
                <p>Payouts won by a team orphaned will be put into the following year's pool for 1st place.</p>
